      I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science department at George
      Washington University. I received my PhD. from Boston University under the
      direction of Professor
      <a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/~richwest/">Richard West</a>. I lead the
      real-time systems, and Operating Systems groups at GWU.

      Much of our research centers around the
      <a href="https://composite.seas.gwu.edu/"
        >Composite component-based operating system</a
      >. Fine grained system policies, mechanisms, and abstractions are defined
      as independent components, which are composed together to create a
      specialized and functional system. In doing so, a focus is on taking
      advantage of the increased system flexibility to bring predictability to
      cloud-scale systems, and rich functionality to embedded systems. Topics of
      interest include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the design and implementation of operating systems</li>
      <li>real-time and embedded systems</li>
      <li>operating system dependability</li>
      <li>embedded system security</li>
      <li>specialized and component-based systems</li>
      <li>operating systems for massive parallelism</li>
      <li>parallel data-structures</li>
    </ul>
